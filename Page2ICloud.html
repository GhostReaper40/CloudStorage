<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:200%;">Cloud Storage</p>


<p style="font-family:verdana;background-color:DodgerBlue;">To begin with, iCloud is a cloud storage software that is owned and managed by Apple.
 Due to this, iCloud is automatically intergrated into all of Apples products.
 ICloud is capable of storingphotos, videos, documents and apps.
 This allows all types of data that is collected upon an apple divice to be transfured and accessed by other divices owned by that Apple consumer.
 As well as the individual that owns this content, the Apples consumers can easily share calender events, locations and other content such as photos with theirs friends and family.
 With iCloud having access to your divices location, a program called "Find My iPhone" can be used on anyother Apple product owned by a user, in order to locate a recently misplaced divice such as a mobile phone or a tablet.
