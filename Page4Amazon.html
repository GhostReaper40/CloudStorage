Amazon Drive is a cloud storage software that allows users to save and access data such as photos, videos, documents and music.
This is not a free service such a others are, it is however free for amazon premium users. Each member that owns an amazon account has access to their own vault.
 These contain all of their own files, however you can create a family vault consisting of 6 members that can upload and share their own photos for the others to have access to.
As well as this, users can create groups of up to 50 members for the ability to share, disguse and react to each others input, 2500 of these are allowed to be created by each user.
Amazon Drive offers the users that live in the US a service called Amazon Prints, this is a process that allows users to select a file they would like to be printed out for them and delivered to their door.
